# Coding exercise 

In the begging, Simple web application I accomplished in this task by creating two repositories the first one for the backend and the second one for the frontend, 
I started with the front end since I have the Dumyah Apis ready, I learned a lot when I worked on the UI as for the last 4 years I have been working on the back end side, so you may be lost some front end skills, So what I learned reactjs and reducx also starting an app from scratch, it is a story when you are working in the big companies most of the tools are ready as most of your work in maintenance and adding features.


Finally, 
It was an interesting task and I was hope there is more time to add a lot of ideas to add on both the front and back end like adding unit tests and making UI creative.
